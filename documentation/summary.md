## Key System Components

### Frontend Components

The frontend is built as a Next.js application with the following key components:

1. **Dashboard Overview**: Provides a high-level view of the system's status and key metrics
2. **Pig Details**: Displays detailed information about individual pigs, including health records and posture data
3. **Farm Management**: Manages farms, barns, and stalls in the system
4. **User Management**: Manages user accounts and permissions
5. **Authentication**: Handles user login and session management

### Backend Services

The backend is organized into the following logical services:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and token management
2. **User Management Service**: Manages user accounts and permissions
3. **Farm Management Service**: Manages farms, barns, and stalls
4. **Pig Management Service**: Manages pig data and health records
5. **Data Collection Service**: Collects and processes sensor data
6. **Analytics Service**: Generates statistics and insights
7. **Notification Service**: Provides real-time updates via Socket.IO
8. **Activity Logging Service**: Logs system activities for audit purposes

### Database Collections

The MongoDB database includes the following main collections:

1. **Pigs**: Stores information about individual pigs
2. **Farms**: Stores information about farms
3. **Barns**: Stores information about barns within farms
4. **Stalls**: Stores information about stalls within barns
5. **Users**: Stores user account information
6. **PostureData**: Stores pig posture measurements
7. **PigHealthStatus**: Stores pig health status records
8. **Devices**: Stores information about monitoring devices
9. **ActivityLog**: Stores system activity logs

## System Workflows

### User Authentication Flow

1. User provides credentials (email/password)
2. Backend verifies credentials against stored data
3. Upon successful verification, a JWT token is generated
4. Token is stored in the client (localStorage)
5. Subsequent requests include the token in the Authorization header
6. Backend verifies the token for each protected request

### Data Collection Flow

1. Sensors collect data from pigs and their environment
2. Data is transmitted to the backend API
3. Backend validates the incoming data
4. Valid data is stored in the database
5. Real-time processing generates insights
6. Connected clients receive updates via Socket.IO

### Farm Management Flow

1. Admin creates a farm with basic information
2. Admin adds barns to the farm
3. Admin adds stalls to the barns
4. Admin assigns users to the farm
5. Users with appropriate permissions can manage the farm

### Pig Management Flow

1. User adds a pig to the system with basic information
2. User assigns the pig to a specific stall
3. System collects and processes data about the pig
4. User can view pig details and health records
5. User can update pig information as needed

## Getting Started

For new team members, we recommend starting with the following documentation:

1. **[High-Level System Architecture](./architecture/high-level-system.md)**: To get a broad understanding of the system
2. **[Frontend Overall Architecture](./frontend/overall-architecture.md)**: To understand the frontend structure
3. **[Backend Overall Architecture](./backend/overall-architecture.md)**: To understand the backend structure
4. **[Database Schema](./database/database-schema.md)**: To understand the data model
5. **[Code Structure](./internal/code-structure.md)**: To understand the coding conventions
